## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hemanggour/System-Agent.git
   cd System-Agent
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On Unix or MacOS:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your configuration:
   ```
   # Required: Choose one of the following API keys
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key  # Default provider (Gemini)
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

   # Optional: Configure model settings
   MODEL=gemini:gemini-2.0-flash  # Default model
   MODEL_TEMPERATURE=0.7  # Default: 0.7
   
   # Email configuration (required for email features)
   SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
   EMAIL_USE_SSL=False
   EMAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your_email@example.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password
   
   # Agent configuration
   AGENT_NAME=ThinkPad  # Customize your agent's name
   MEMORY_WINDOW_SIZE=20  # Number of messages to keep in memory
   VERBOSE=True  # Enable verbose output
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Run the agent with default settings**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Advanced Usage with Custom LLM

You can use any LangChain-compatible LLM with the AIAgent. Here's an example using Ollama with a local model:

```python
from system_agent.agent import AIAgent
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama

# Initialize a local LLM using Ollama
# Make sure you have pulled the model first: `ollama pull llama3`
llm = ChatOllama(
    model="llama3",  # or any other model you've pulled (e.g., "mistral", "gemma")
    temperature=0.2,
    # Add any other model-specific parameters
)

# Create the agent with your custom LLM
agent = AIAgent(llm=llm)

# Run commands
response = agent.run("Explain system AI agents in simple terms.")
print(response)
```

To use this example, you'll need to install the Ollama integration:
```bash
pip install langchain-ollama
```

2. **Interact with the agent**:
   - Type your commands in natural language
   - Type 'memory' to see conversation history
   - Type 'clear' to clear the conversation memory
   - Type 'quit', 'exit', or 'bye' to exit

### Example Commands

- File Operations:
  - "Read the contents of notes.txt"
  - "Create a file called todo.txt with my tasks"
  - "List all files in the current directory"

- Web Operations:
  - "Scrape the latest news from example.com"
  - "Search for information about LangChain"

- System Operations:
  - "Show system information"
  - "Check disk usage"

- Email:
  - "Send an email to test@example.com with subject 'Hello' and body 'This is a test'"

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Key configuration options in `.env`:

5. **First Run Authentication**
   On first run, the agent will open a browser window for OAuth authentication. 
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Grant the requested permissions
   - The token will be saved to `token.pickle` for future use

### Example Usage

```python
# After setting up, the agent will automatically have access to Google Workspace tools
# Example: Create a new Google Doc
response = agent.run("Create a new Google Doc named 'Project Plan' with some initial content")
print(response)
```

### Security Notes
- Never commit `credentials.json` or `token.pickle` to version control
- Add these files to your `.gitignore`:
  ```
  credentials.json
  token.pickle
  ```
- The token is stored locally and can be revoked at any time from your Google Account settings

### Optional Dependencies
